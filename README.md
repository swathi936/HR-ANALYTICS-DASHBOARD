# HR-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD
I recently created this HR Analytics Dashboard to analyze employee attrition trends. This dashboard provides key insights into attrition based on various factors, helping HR teams make data-driven decisions.

Key Insights:
✅ Overall Attrition Rate: 16.1% (237 employees out of 1470)
✅ Attrition by Age: The highest attrition occurs in the 26-35 age group (116 employees).
✅ Attrition by Education: Life Sciences has the highest attrition (38%), followed by Medical (27%).
✅ Attrition by Salary: Employees earning up to 5K have the highest attrition (163 employees).
✅ Attrition by Job Role: Laboratory Technicians (62 employees) and Sales Executives (57 employees) are the most affected roles.
✅ Years at Company: Most employees leave within 1 year (59 employees), indicating early-stage attrition concerns.

This dashboard helps HR teams identify critical problem areas and implement retention strategies to improve employee satisfaction and reduce turnover.
